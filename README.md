# 🔢 Digit Recognition with AI

This project uses machine learning to recognize handwritten digits (1–10) from images.

> ⚠️ This is a prototype and educational project created to experiment with AI, image processing and model training.

## 🧠 Features

- Reads images of digits
- Predicts which digit is shown using trained model
- Custom dataset or MNIST-like data
- Written in Python

## 📦 Used Technologies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras (or other)
- NumPy, matplotlib, PIL, etc.
